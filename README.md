# Global-climate-change-analysis
Air is one of the important factor for us and we can see that it is deteriorating day by day, which in return is causing many health problems and increasing the temperatures of the planet which is leading to change in climatic pattern and many other short term problems which we are able to notice, there are also many long term effects of this pollution which we are not giving much importance. These include depletion of polar ice caps, increase in sea levels and depletion of ozone layer which would have severe effect on our environment. We would like to throw light on these long-term problems and their relationship with increase in air pollution. We are analyzing the patterns of various air pollutants from the past 20 years from each country and continent. We are taking data from fifteen different datasets form UN data report understanding each of them, cleaning and filling the missed data using tidyr, diply. We used ggplot2 for plotting their graphs, to visualize their trends and determining the major air pollutant, the sources from which it is being emitted. The effects of this pollution on the depletion of snow caps, raise in sea level and the increase in the pollution levels depending on the GDP of each country. We are also predicting the future parameters of each data using machine learning algorithms.
